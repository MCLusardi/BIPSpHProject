# BIPSpHProject
This code has been assembled and compiled by MC Lusardi during the academic year of Fall 2020 - Spring 2021 for the BIPS Lab (Bioinformatics in Plant Science) at the University of Missouri. It contains code to set up an automated pH experiment in the lab with two different sensor brands, Atlas Scientific micro pH probes and DFRobot Gravity pH meter Pros.

Atlas Scientific Sensor setup:
  To run an experiment with atlas scientific sensors, you will need an EZO pH Circut for each sensor. This can be wired in one of two ways. Either, you can plug the cirtut into
